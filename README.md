# The Blind Printmaker

The Blind Printmaker is an artificial intelligence which produces original artistic images via computational logic. The software learns from human evaluation, developing over time. The aim of the project is to crowd-source a set of computer interperatable guidelines which most successfully interface with the human visual and emotional systems and in a sense 'hack' into a creative art space.
